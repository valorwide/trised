# Trised
Trised bring connectivity to unconnected schools. We noticed that in Asia and Africa maximum primary school has a lack of connectivity. Children are not getting proper education and health service due to connectivity. While we can have stable connectivity with schools then the other teachers can share the knowledge with another school teacher. Other school teachers can take the class remotely and share the content easily. And health care centers can take care of children remotely. This connectivity will happen by mesh connectivity. This service will solve the multipole issue. This system can translate voices like the English language, Bangla. Video conference, Text messaging,  content sharing. Without the internet, this system will also work. For the long-distance user can also communicate.  This protocol will create our own TR system. So where the internet is unavailable this system will connect the world. (We are still analyzing for the better) 

# Mission Statement
 Unconnected school to be connected 
## Features!

  - Mesh connection will be established.
  - Create a bridge of connectivity ( Unconnected school to be connected0
  - Admin will have the previledge to select multiple languages.
  - As the admin broadcasts the text, audio or video, other users will be able to see the data.
  - Multiple translation data can be sent to multiple users in real time.
  
  ## Which problem we are trying to solve?
Trised bring connectivity to unconnected schools. Trised Blockchain & Mesh networking based solution to create connectivity for unconnected school. Trised autonomously discovers and builds multi-hop, peer-to-peer mesh networks using smartphones and smart TV. 
Trised also provides the ability to fill up the gap of internet connection while offering on-demand internet connectivity to nearby users. This system will cover,  voice and text translation, Text messaging, voice calling, video calling, multimedia school class, health tips,  Monitoring system,  tips broadcasting. These features will work without the internet as well the internet.
This system will work flowing map: The available user will get a list of the connected users. They can communicate with each and other without any internet.  For long-distance, our TS system will create the protocol for connecting all networks. Suppose have 3 mesh network in 3 deference locations. Every mesh network has one person’s minimum internet. Suppose a person from mesh network A  to calling to a person of mesh network B.  If the person wants to distribute the broadcast in all A mesh network person for the live broadcast. All members can watch the same video at a time with a single internet cost. So a single internet cost all are connected at the same time.  Main components: Android phone and android TV.
Main User: School Teachers, would-be students, parents, the education sector, and health care center. 
An ETC-based crypto-economic model incentivizes users for subscription fees. Inherent network trust and digital tokens help to the subscriber. 

## Work progress (prototype)
Initial prototyping working for text message translation and minimum connectivity creates.  Also, play the role of the bridge of internet connectivity. We are doing RnD for a large amount of mesh connectivity and long add long-distance connectivity. We have a target if users don’t have the internet the user can communicate with long-distance users. We are analyzing the mobile operators’ network policy.  It’s the required time but we got positive feedback from the mobile operator. We hope our mission will be a success. Users will get the opportunity to use all Trised features without paying any money by using the mobile operator’s network.
